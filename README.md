# CoreXrY

#### Author: Eaden McKee

## CoreXrY is a (new?) Kinematic Motion system for 3d printers or CNC machines.

It uses two closed loop belts around the A and B Drives, which each turn a pulley on the X axis. Those pullys each turn a pulley which moves the Y belt, which is connected to the end effector and moves on the Y axis.

The differential motion of the A and B motor can move the end effector in any direction on the X and Y axis.

The motion control software required is the same as CoreXY.

## Possible Advantages
Shorter Belt Lengths. The overall belt length for CoreXrY is shorter than CoreXY.
